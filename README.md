If you can help in any way i would appritiate it because this is my first time using github.

If you want to see what's needed you can go to the issues tab and help fix the things that are listed.

Any suggestions are welcome and please if you are commiting something double check to ensure that it doesn't have any copyrighted material and if so please state where you got it from.

You can fork and use it how you want but please don't put it up on a domain without getting authorization from me.

Everyone is free to commit and make changes and they are supervised by me, Thanks :D
